# Vite 7 Update - Vulnerability Fix

## Issue
After migrating to Vite 5, there were still **2 moderate vulnerabilities** in `esbuild` (a dependency of Vite):

- **esbuild** â‰¤0.24.2 - Development server can be accessed by malicious websites
- **vite** 0.11.0 - 6.1.6 - Affected by esbuild vulnerability

## Solution
Updated to Vite 7.1.11 which includes a patched version of esbuild.

## Changes Made

### package.json
- Updated `vite` from `^5.0.8` to `^7.1.11`
- Updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` from `^4.2.1` to `^5.0.0`

### Breaking Changes
Vite 7 is a major version update, but the changes are minimal for most projects:

1. **Node.js Requirement**: Vite 7 requires Node.js 18.20+ or 20.10+
2. **Plugin API**: The React plugin v5 is compatible with Vite 7
3. **No Code Changes**: Your application code remains unchanged

## Installation Commands

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# Remove old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Install updated dependencies
npm install

# Verify no vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Test the application
npm start
```

## Expected Results

After running `npm audit`, you should see:
```
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Development server**: `npm start` should work without errors
2. **Build**: `npm run build` should complete successfully
3. **All features**: Test your routes, images, forms, etc.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Revert package.json changes
git checkout package.json

# Reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Additional Notes

- Vite 7 is faster and more stable than Vite 5
- No changes to your React components or application logic
- The vite.config.js remains compatible
- All existing scripts continue to work the same way
